## Coursera Data Science Specialization Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R code assumes that you have downloaded and unziped the data from
> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and have set the unzipped folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" as your working directory.

Once this is done, the code is run. The code is well commented in the run_analysis.R script.
